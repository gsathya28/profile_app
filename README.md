Profile App

## Running the App

This app should run like any other Flutter app in debug mode.
Simply install [flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)  
Then run 'flutter doctor' and 'flutter run' after connecting a device.
Tested on Web and Android.
Flutter version: 2.5

## Design Notes + Todos
Has user data for holding/encapsulating user info together.
Since each field has it's own page, there is no real advantage to encapsulating (yet).
No real input validation yet. There are very simple validators set up in the user object waiting to be used.

Also couldn't get the image_picker working either. Will need to investigate.
